# Dog Breed Classifier

## Overview

This repository contains my first project on machine learning as part of the Udacity "AI with Python Programming" course. The project is a Dog Breed Classifier, and it provided me with valuable insights into handling a larger-scale project. Throughout this project, I learned the significance of reading documentation for existing tools, libraries, and related projects, as well as the importance of studying docstrings and hints.

## Project Description

### Purpose

The purpose of the Dog Breed Classifier project is to create a machine learning model that can classify images of dogs into specific breeds. The model is trained on a dataset of dog images and uses a pre-trained deep learning model for image classification.

### Learning Objectives

Through this project, I achieved the following learning objectives:

1. **Large Project Handling**: I gained hands-on experience in managing a larger-scale machine learning project. This included organizing code, handling multiple files, and ensuring modularity.

2. **Documentation Understanding**: I learned the importance of thoroughly reading and understanding documentation. This was crucial for implementing various functionalities and leveraging pre-existing tools effectively.

3. **Docstrings and Hints**: Understanding and utilizing docstrings and hints in the code. These provided valuable information about functions and methods, making it easier to navigate through the project.

4. **Data Handling**: The project involved working with a diverse dataset of dog images. I gained insights into preprocessing data, managing labels, and handling image files.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `models/`: Includes the pre-trained model used for image classification.
- `predictions/`: Stores the model predictions on sample images.
- `adjust_results4_isadog.py`: A script to adjust the results dictionary based on whether the labels are of-a-dog.
- `dog_app.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and documentation.
- `dognames.txt`: A text file containing dog names used in the project.
- `README.md`: The project's README file.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to Udacity for providing the AI with Python Programming course, which laid the foundation for this project. Additionally, thanks to the open-source community for creating and maintaining the tools and libraries used in this project.
